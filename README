=======================================

GUYS updates your status

guys is an all around solution to update your status accross social networks without opening the browser, because we hate the browser. It's slow, bloated, and inefficient to conduct singular and specific tasks.

use this c++ project to learn and exercise c++ knowledge.

r.d.
