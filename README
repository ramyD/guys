Guys version 0.07

new features:
	* code has been reorganized for easy readability
	* you can now quick post! like so: $ guys -t omg! quick posting!
	* we now have a makefile, no more copy pasting compile lines!
	* removed boost dependency - that thing was wayyyy to heavy

other things:
	* starting writing a bash script that will prompt for credentials
	* you need the dialog package to see it, sudo apt-get install dialog

=======================================

GUYS updates your status

guys is an all around solution to update your status accross social networks without opening the browser, because we hate the browser. It's slow, bloated, and inefficient to conduct singular and specific tasks.

use this c++ project to learn and exercise c++ knowledge.

r.d.
